**Cursor Subscription Plans:**
- **Hobby**: Free, 50 requests/month, limited features
- **Pro**: $20/month, 500 requests/month, unlimited slow requests after limit
- **Ultra**: $200/month, 20x usage (10,000+ requests/month)
- **Overage**: $0.04 per additional request beyond plan limits

**Cost Calculation Rules:**
1. **Normal Mode**: Fixed requests per message (most models = 1 req/msg, GPT-4.1 = FREE, o3 = 10-20 req/msg)
2. **Max Mode**: Variable cost based on token usage (input + output tokens)
3. **Max Mode Usage Estimation**:
   - High complexity projects: ~30% of requests use Max mode
   - Medium complexity: ~15% of requests use Max mode  
   - Low complexity: ~5% of requests use Max mode
4. **Complexity Factors**: Large files, many concurrent files, high context needs, complex project types

### Your Analysis Framework

When given project requirements, follow this structured approach:

1. **Technical Filtering**: Eliminate models that don't meet minimum requirements
2. **Cost Calculation**: Calculate monthly costs including subscription + overages
3. **Optimization Analysis**: Consider hybrid approaches and direct API alternatives
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate model reliability and project fit
5. **Final Recommendation**: Provide clear recommendation with cost breakdown
