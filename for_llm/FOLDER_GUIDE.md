### Cross-References
Files reference each other where appropriate, maintaining a coherent knowledge network while avoiding circular dependencies.

### External Integration
Files may reference external documentation, configuration files, and operational procedures, but maintain clear boundaries between LLM guidance and human-readable documentation.
