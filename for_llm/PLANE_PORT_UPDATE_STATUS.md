# Plane Port Configuration Update - Status Report
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Issue**: Plane moving ports  
**Resolution**: Updated to port 8080

## Summary

You correctly identified that Plane was moving ports. The system was originally configured for port 80, but there was a port conflict. I've successfully updated the entire Plane-Cursor integration to use **port 8080**.

## Changes Made

### 1. Docker Configuration
- **docker-compose.yml**: Updated proxy port from `${NGINX_PORT}:80` to `8080:80`
- **docker-compose-local.yml**: Updated proxy port from `${NGINX_PORT}:80` to `8080:80`

### 2. Cursor Integration Configuration  
- **for_llm/plane-local.env**: Updated `PLANE_API_URL` from `http://localhost` to `http://localhost:8080`
- **for_llm/cursor-mcp-config.json**: Updated `PLANE_API_URL` to `http://localhost:8080`
- **for_llm/setup-cursor-integration.ps1**: Updated all references to use port 8080

## Current Status

### âœ… Successfully Completed
- Port conflict resolved
- All configuration files updated
- Plane containers running on port 8080
- Docker compose services are up and running:
  ```
  plane-working-proxy-1        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp
  ```

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Development build**: The local development containers are currently building
- **Web service**: Running in development mode with Turborepo
- **Frontend services**: May take additional time to complete initial build

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. **Wait for build completion**: The development containers need time to complete their initial build
2. **Test API endpoint**: Once ready, test `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health/`
3. **Verify web interface**: Test `http://localhost:8080` for the main interface
4. **Configure API key**: Add your Plane API key to the MCP configuration
5. **Restart Cursor**: Complete the integration setup

## Technical Details

### Container Status
All containers are running:
- `plane-working-proxy-1`: âœ… Up (port 8080)
- `plane-working-web-1`: âœ… Up (building)
- `plane-working-api-1`: âœ… Up 
- `plane-working-admin-1`: âœ… Up
- `plane-working-space-1`: âœ… Up
- `plane-working-live-1`: âœ… Up
- Database & Redis: âœ… Up

### Port Mapping
- **External Port**: 8080
- **Internal Port**: 80
- **Full Mapping**: `0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp`

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to get 502/timeout errors:
1. **Wait longer**: Development builds can take 5-10 minutes
2. **Check logs**: `docker logs plane-working-web-1`
3. **Restart if needed**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml restart`

## Integration Ready

The Plane-Cursor integration configuration is now correctly set for port 8080. Once the development build completes, you'll be able to:
- Access Plane at `http://localhost:8080`
- Use the MCP server with Cursor
- Manage Plane projects through natural language in Cursor

**All files committed to git with proper documentation.**
