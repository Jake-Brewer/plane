# Work Analysis and Task List
# Created: 2025-01-27T00:00:00Z

## Project Overview
This appears to be the Plane project - an open-source project management tool with Linear integration capability. Based on my analysis, this is a large, complex project with multiple components.

## Current Status Analysis

### Completed Items
✅ Git repository is up to date (recently committed and pushed docs)
✅ for_llm directory structure is well-organized with specialized guidance files
✅ llm_owned_notes folder created for my working notes

### Documentation Assessment

#### Existing Documentation
- ✅ Main README.md (comprehensive, well-maintained)
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md (detailed contributor guide)  
- ✅ for_llm/FOLDER_GUIDE.md (excellent organization)
- ✅ All specialized guidance files in for_llm/ directory

#### Missing FOLDER_GUIDE.md Files (Per primer standards)
Based on primer requirement: "Create FOLDER_GUIDE.md in every directory"

Need to check which directories are missing FOLDER_GUIDE.md files.

## Identified Work Items

### High Priority
1. **Missing _llm_project_primer.md** - Referenced in main primer but doesn't exist
2. **Missing docs/working_with_llm/ directory** - Referenced in FOLDER_GUIDE.md
3. **Incomplete Linear project management setup** - Need to verify Linear integration status
4. **Missing FOLDER_GUIDE.md files** - Need to identify which directories lack them

### Medium Priority  
1. **Documentation consistency** - Ensure all timestamps are current
2. **Project structure validation** - Verify all references in guidance files are accurate
3. **Test Linear API integration** - Ensure credentials and setup work properly

### Low Priority
1. **Code quality checks** - Review any TODO/FIXME items found
2. **Documentation improvements** - Enhance existing docs where needed

## Next Actions
1. Create missing _llm_project_primer.md file
2. Create missing docs/working_with_llm/ directory structure
3. Audit directories for missing FOLDER_GUIDE.md files  
4. Verify Linear integration setup
5. Test API connections if possible

## Questions/Clarifications Needed
- None identified yet - proceeding with work I can complete autonomously

## Cleanup Tasks
- Remove this work_analysis.md file when all work is complete
- Clean up any temporary files created during work
