# Security-Assessor Workspace Guide
# Last Updated: 2025-01-27T00:53:00Z

## Purpose

This workspace contains tracking files and progress documentation for the comprehensive security assessment of the Plane project management system. The assessment focuses on local deployment with multi-agent LLM access via MCP integration.

## Scope

### In-Scope
- Docker container security assessment
- Data integrity and backup strategy analysis
- Multi-agent access control design
- MCP integration security requirements
- Local deployment risk assessment
- Source code completeness verification

### Out-of-Scope
- External threat analysis (firewall-protected local deployment)
- Production cloud deployment security
- General security best practices documentation
- Human user authentication systems

## Files in This Directory

### Progress Tracking
- **`llm_todo_security-assessment.md`** (7.8KB, 175 lines)
  - Master todo list and progress tracking
  - Chunked work breakdown with overlapping ranges
  - Risk assessment matrix
  - Implementation timeline and priorities
  - Agent workspace management

## Work Breakdown Structure

### Phase 1: File Inventory & Risk Classification
- Complete project file inventory
- Risk classification by component
- Security-relevant file identification

### Phase 2: Chunk-by-Chunk Analysis
- **Chunk 1**: Core Infrastructure Security (docker-compose, nginx, deployment)
- **Chunk 2**: Database & Backend Security (apiserver/, PostgreSQL, Django)
- **Chunk 3**: API Security & Authentication (API endpoints, JWT, agent access)
- **Chunk 4**: Frontend Security (web/, admin/, space/ applications)
- **Chunk 5**: Package & Dependency Security (vulnerability scanning)

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent Integration Requirements
- Database schema design for agent management
- MCP integration architecture
- Timeout and assignment mechanisms

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
- High priority security fixes
- Medium priority enhancements
- Deployment recommendations

## Agent Information

**Agent Name**: Security-Assessor  
**Specialty**: Container security, multi-agent deployment analysis  
**Work Pattern**: Systematic chunk-by-chunk analysis with overlapping ranges  
**Primary Concerns**: Data loss prevention, extraction capability, agent access control  

## Progress Tracking Standards

### Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Task fully finished and documented
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Currently working on task
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Waiting to start or blocked
- üî¥ **High Priority**: Critical security concern
- üü° **Medium Priority**: Important but not critical
- üü¢ **Low Priority**: Nice to have improvement

### Update Requirements
- Update timestamps when making changes
- Mark tasks as completed when finished
- Add notes and findings as work progresses
- Reference specific file locations and line numbers

## Integration Points

### Main Assessment Output
Results feed into `docs/local_deployment_security_assessment.md` for human consumption.

### Related Workspaces
- General progress tracking in `../progress_summary.md`
- Cross-references to specialized guidance in `for_llm/` directory

### Implementation Coordination
Security recommendations may require coordination with other agents or manual implementation.
